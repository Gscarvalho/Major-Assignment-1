# Major-Assignment-1

The assignment is to create a website consisting of one singular page focusing on an art movement.
The art movement I selected is the Lowbrow art or Pop Surrealism.

My intention is to you glossy colors and fluid animations to give the site an 'artsy' feel. Almost like a candy shop of art.

See Works Cited for list of artists and artwork.
