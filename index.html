                    Lowbrow art, also known as <strong>pop surrealism</strong>, is a subculture that emerged in the 1970s
                    and 1980s as a reaction to the highbrow art world. This movement is characterized by 
                    its <strong>bold</strong>, <strong>provocative</strong> style and use of popular culture references, such as comic books 
                    and graffiti. Lowbrow artists often use <strong>bright colors</strong> and <strong>exaggerated features</strong> to 
                    create surreal, thought-provoking imagery.

                    The term <strong class="sub-strong-1">"lowbrow"</strong> was originally used as a derogatory label for the movement, 
                    but it was later embraced by the artists themselves. 
                    Lowbrow art is a form of pop culture-inspired art that emerged in the <strong class="sub-strong-2">'70</strong><strong class="sub-strong-1">s</strong> 
                    and <strong class="sub-strong-2">'80</strong><strong class="sub-strong-1">s</strong> in the United States. 
                    The movement was initially centered around <i>Los Angeles</i> and was heavily influenced by the punk and new wave music scenes of the time.
                    <br>
                    The lowbrow art movement was started by a group of artists who were dissatisfied with the 
                    mainstream art world and sought to create work that was more accessible 
                    and relatable to the general public. These artists often drew inspiration from popular culture, including 
                    <strong class="sub-strong-2">comic</strong><strong class="sub-strong-1">books</strong>, <strong class="sub-strong-2">movies</strong>, 
                    and <strong class="sub-strong-2">television</strong><strong class="sub-strong-1">shows</strong>. 
                    They also incorporated elements of traditional art forms, such as painting and illustration, into their work.
                    <br>
                    Lowbrow art often features <strong class="sub-strong-2">bold</strong><strong class="sub-strong-1">colors</strong>, 
                    <strong class="sub-strong-2">thick</strong><strong class="sub-strong-1">lines</strong>, and <strong class="sub-strong-1">exaggerated</strong><strong class="sub-strong-2">forms</strong>. 
                    The subjects of the artwork are usually pop culture icons, such as cartoon characters, 
                    celebrities, and consumer products. The style of lowbrow art is often considered to be a combination of 
                    <strong class="sub-strong-2">street</strong><strong class="sub-strong-1">art</strong>, <strong class="sub-strong-2">pop</strong>
                    <strong class="sub-strong-1">art</strong>, and <strong class="sub-strong-2">underground</strong><strong class="sub-strong-1">comics</strong>.
                    <br>
                    The lowbrow art movement quickly gained popularity and began to influence other 
                    forms of <strong class="sub-strong-1">popular</strong><strong class="sub-strong-2">culture</strong>. Many lowbrow artists have become successful commercial artists 
                    and have been commissioned to create artwork for movies, television shows, and album covers. 
                    Some of the most prominent lowbrow artists include Robert Williams, Mark Ryden, and Gary Baseman.
                    <br>
                    In recent years, the lowbrow art movement has continued to <strong class="sub-strong-2">evolve</strong> and has gained even more mainstream acceptance. 
                    Today, lowbrow art is considered to be a legitimate form of contemporary art, 
                    and is exhibited in galleries and museums around the world.
