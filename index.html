        <!-- <p>
            Lowbrow art is a form of pop culture-inspired art that emerged in the 1970s and 1980s in the United States. The term "lowbrow" was originally used as a derogatory label for the movement, but it was later embraced by the artists themselves. The movement was initially centered around Los Angeles and was heavily influenced by the punk and new wave music scenes of the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lowbrow art movement was started by a group of artists who were dissatisfied with the mainstream art world and sought to create work that was more accessible and relatable to the general public. These artists often drew inspiration from popular culture, including comic books, movies, and television shows. They also incorporated elements of traditional art forms, such as painting and illustration, into their work.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Lowbrow art often features bold colors, thick lines, and exaggerated forms. The subjects of the artwork are usually pop culture icons, such as cartoon characters, celebrities, and consumer products. The style of lowbrow art is often considered to be a combination of street art, pop art, and underground comics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lowbrow art movement quickly gained popularity and began to influence other forms of popular culture. Many lowbrow artists have become successful commercial artists and have been commissioned to create artwork for movies, television shows, and album covers. Some of the most prominent lowbrow artists include Robert Williams, Mark Ryden, and Gary Baseman. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In recent years, the lowbrow art movement has continued to evolve and has gained even more mainstream acceptance. The movement has also inspired other subcultures, such as the kawaii art movement in Japan, which is heavily influenced by lowbrow art. Today, lowbrow art is considered to be a legitimate form of contemporary art, and is exhibited in galleries and museums around the world.
